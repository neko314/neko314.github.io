**This is the site that I developed at Actindi, Inc. in Tokyo in 2019-2020**

The site is ["iko-yo"](https://iko-yo.net/), a web media  for parents whom want to find where to go to with their children.
In 2020, I developed new EC site (subdomain of the media site)and we start to sale web tickets on the site. The users can get tickets online in advance at a bargain! Many users tell us the tickets help them to go out easy with their young children. I'm so happy to hear these reviews and very proud to developing a wonderful product.
